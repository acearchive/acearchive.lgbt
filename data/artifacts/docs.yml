slugs: |
  Every artifact in the repository has a URL like:

  <https://acearchive.lgbt/artifact/orlando-the-asexual-manifesto>

  When you add a new artifact, you need to choose a URL slug for it, which is
  that last part of the path.

  A URL slug should always be lowercase and use hyphens to separate words, and
  it will generally follow the format `author-title`. If the author has a first
  and last name (i.e. isn't a handle or username), you can just use the last
  name. If the title of the work is long, you can use a shortened version of
  it. If there is no obvious author associated with the work, you can just use
  the title.

  If the combination of the author and the title of the work is ambiguous,
  (such as a forum thread where the title of the thread might just be
  "asexuality"), then you can provide additional context like
  `context-author-title`. For an AVEN forum thread by "coolasexualperson"
  called "romance", the URL slug might be
  `aven-forums-coolasexualperson-romance`.
