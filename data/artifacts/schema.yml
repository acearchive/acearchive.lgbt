      Sometimes the format of artifact files changes. This is the version
      number for the artifact file format. This will be set to the current
      version when you open a pull request, so you can leave it alone.

      This is the title of the artifact. If the artifact represents a
      creative work (a book, essay, blog post, etc.), this should be the
      title of that work. If the artifact encompasses multiple works or
      doesn’t have an obvious title, it can be a short description instead.
      You should always quote or italicize the titles of works, and you can
      add italics in an artifact title using HTML `<em>Title of Work</em>`
      syntax.

      This is a short, one sentence description of the artifact that should
      provide context and explain its significance to the queer community (i.e.
      why it’s in the archive). This description should complete the sentence
      “This artifact is…”

      If you want to provide more context than you can fit in the short
      description, you can optionally provide a longer description that will
      appear in the page for the artifact. This should also complete the
      sentence "This artifact is..."

          works, this should generally include the title of the work so people
          can disambiguate them. If the artifact consists of a single work, it

          MIME type of a file, you can use [mimetype.io](https://mimetype.io/) to
          look it up. If the file is a format that doesn't have a well-known MIME

      A list of (usually 1-4) people closely associated with the artifact,
      such as the author of a book, the subject of a photo, the original
      poster of a forum thread, the person who coined a new term, etc. This
      is helpful for linking together different artifacts which are
      associated with the same people. This can be omitted if the people

      A list of queer identities associated with the artifact. For example,
      if this is a blog post about aromanticism, then "aromantic" should be
      included in the list of identities. The identity should be in adjective
      form, meaning it can complete the sentence, "Artifacts about _ people".
      This can be omitted if the identities associated with the work aren't
      clear (e.g. it's about queer identities as a whole).

      redirect to the new one. For new artifacts, you should omit this.
