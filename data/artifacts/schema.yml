  version:
    name: "Version"
    type: "integer"
    required: true
    description: >
      Sometimes the format of artifact files changes. This is the version
      number for the artifact file format. This will be set to the current
      version when you open a pull request, so you can leave it alone.
  title:
    name: "Title"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    description: >
      This is the title of the artifact. If the artifact represents a
      creative work (a book, essay, blog post, etc.), this should be the
      title of that work. If the artifact encompasses multiple works or
      doesn’t have an obvious title, it can be a short description instead.
      You should always quote or italicize the titles of works, and you can
      add italics in an artifact title using HTML `<em>Title of Work</em>`
      syntax.
  description:
    name: "Short Description"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    description: >
      This is a short, one sentence description of the artifact that should
      provide context and explain its significance to the queer community (i.e.
      why it’s in the archive). This description should complete the sentence
      “This artifact is…”
  longDescription:
    name: "Long Description"
    type: "string"
    required: false
    description: >
      If you want to provide more context than you can fit in the short
      description, you can optionally provide a longer description that will
      appear in the page for the artifact. This should also complete the
      sentence "This artifact is..."
  files:
    name: "Files"
    type: "list of dictionaries"
    required: false
    description: >
      The list files to include in the artifact. For more information about
      adding files to artifacts, see [the
      docs](/docs/contributing/uploading-files)
  files.name:
    name: "Label"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    level: 1
    description: >
      A label for the file. If the artifact consists of multiple creative
      works, this should generally include the title of the work so people
      can disambiguate them. If the artifact consists of a single work, it
      can be something short like "Paper," "Transcript," "Citation," etc.
  files.mediaType:
    name: "Media Type"
    type: "string"
    required: false
    level: 1
    description: >
      The file type of the file. This should be formatted as a MIME type like
      `application/pdf` or `image/png`. If you need help figuring out the
      MIME type of a file, you can use [mimetype.io](https://mimetype.io/) to
      look it up. If the file is a format that doesn't have a well-known MIME
      type, you can omit this.
  files.filename:
    name: "File Name"
    type: "string"
    required: false
    level: 1
    description: >
      A file name to be used when downloading the file. This should use
      hyphens instead of spaces and should always include an appropriate file
      extension. If the file is actually a directory containing multiple
      files, you can omit this.
  files.cid:
    name: "CID"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    level: 1
    description: >
      This is the CID (content identifier) of the file. To include a file in an
      artifact, you need to upload it to [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage),
      copy the CID it gives you, and paste it here.
  links:
    name: "Links"
    type: "list of dictionaries"
    required: false
    description: >
      A list of links to web sites to include in the artifact.
  links.name:
    name: "Label"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    level: 1
    description: >
      A label for the link. If the artifact consists of multiple creative
      works, this should generally include the title of the work so people
      can disambiguate them. If the artifact consists of a single work, it
      can be something short like “Paper,” “Transcript,” “Citation,” etc.
  links.url:
    name: "URL"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    level: 1
    description: >
      The `https://` URL that the link points to.
  people:
    name: "People"
    type: "list of strings"
    required: false
    description: >
      A list of (usually 1-4) people closely associated with the artifact,
      such as the author of a book, the subject of a photo, the original
      poster of a forum thread, the person who coined a new term, etc. This
      is helpful for linking together different artifacts which are
      associated with the same people. This can be omitted if the people
      associated with the artifact aren't clear or there were many different
      people involved.
  identities:
    name: "Identities"
    type: "list of strings"
    required: false
    description: >
      A list of queer identities associated with the artifact. For example,
      if this is a blog post about aromanticism, then "aromantic" should be
      included in the list of identities. The identity should be in adjective
      form, meaning it can complete the sentence, "Artifacts about _ people".
      This can be omitted if the identities associated with the work aren't
      clear (e.g. it's about queer identities as a whole).
  fromYear:
    name: "Start Year"
    type: "integer"
    required: true
    description: >
      The year the creative work associated with the artifact was published
      (or written, posted, etc.). If the artifact encompasses multiple works
      that were published in different years, this should be the year the
      first work was published.
  toYear:
    name: "End Year"
    type: "integer"
    required: false
    description: >
      If the artifact encompasses multiple creative works that were published
      in different years, this should be the year the last work was
      published. If the works associated with the artifact were only
      published in one year, this should be omitted.
  decades:
    name: "Decades"
    type: "list of integers"
    required: true
    description: >
      The list of decades in which a creative work associated with the
      artifact was published. If a work was published in 1980 and another
      work was published in 2009, this should include 1980 and 2000.
  aliases:
    name: "Aliases"
    type: "list of strings"
    required: false
    description: >
      If the URL slug of an artifact must change for any reason, you must
      specify all of its previous URL slugs here so that the old links can
      redirect to the new one. For new artifacts, you should omit this.
