Anyone can help contribute to Ace Archive, and there are various ways to do so.

<hr>

First and foremost, consider joining our Discord server! We have a "job board"
tracking all the tasks we could use help with, big and small.

Don't feel like you need to have any special skills or prior experience to help
out; however you want to contribute, we're happy to teach and walk you through
it.

Ace Archive is a community project; building community and giving folks the
opportunity to participate in the process is the goal.

If you're not feeling social and just looking to contribute something to the
archive, you can submit a proposal without needing to talk to anyone. All you
have to do is fill out a form and answer a few questions. This requires a GitHub
account, which is free.

If you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, you can also add content to
the archive yourself. This involves filling out a more comprehensive form where
you'll enter all the information necessary to add an artifact to the archive.
Once you complete the form, you'll be redirected to GitHub to submit your
proposal for approval.
