If you would like to contribute content to Ace Archive, you can use this form to
submit an artifact to the repository. Make sure you check out our [best
practices]({{< ref "docs/contributing/best-practices.md" >}}) page for more
information about how to fill out this form. Once you submit the form, you'll be
redirected to GitHub to complete the process. You'll need a GitHub account,
which is free.

Your proposal will need to be approved before it's added to the archive, and
you'll have the chance to make changes if we ask for them. Remember that
whatever you submit to GitHub will be public and viewable by anyone on the
internet.

If you want a simpler option for contributing content to the archive, you can
also [fill out this
form](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-submissions/issues/new?labels=artifact&template=artifact.yml)
to make a suggestion.
