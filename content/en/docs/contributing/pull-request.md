The archive is hosted on GitHub, and to contribute content to the archive,
you'll need to open a *pull request*, which is a proposal to add content to the
website. It's easier than it sounds, and requires no programming or knowledge
of specialized tools! Just follow these steps:

1. Create an [artifact file]({{< ref "docs/contributing/artifact-files" >}}) for the new artifact.
2. Choose a [url slug]({{< ref "docs/contributing/artifact-files#url-slugs" >}}) for the new artifact.
3. Enter the URL slug into the box below and click "Submit," which will redirect you to GitHub.
4. Name the new file "index.md."
5. Paste your artifact file into the page.
6. Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" at the
   bottom of the page and click "Propose new file."

This will open the page to create a new pull request. All you have to do is
briefly describe the new artifact you're adding and press "Create pull
request." Then, a team member can review your contribution and approve it!

Read on for more information about how to create an artifact file.
