Anyone can contribute content to the archive by opening a pull request on
[GitHub](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.org). The process is a little
more involved than contributing to a wiki, but we're working on finding new
ways to simplify it and make contributing as simple as possible.

If you have content you would like to suggest be added to the archive, but
don't want to add it yourself, you can [open an
issue](https://github.com/frawleyskid/acearchive.org/issues/new) on GitHub.
However, the best way to add content to the archive is to do it yourself and
open a pull request.

If you want to learn how to contribute to the archive yourself, the rest of
this section will document the process.
