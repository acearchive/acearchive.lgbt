Anyone can contribute content to the archive by opening a pull request on
[GitHub](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.org). However, currently,
contributing directly requires some basic knowledge of tools like Git, GitHub,
IPFS, and YAML. The goal is to eventually eliminate the need to have knowledge
of esoteric tools in order to contribute. In the meantime, if you have content
you would like to suggest be added to the archive, the easiest way to
contribute is to [open an
issue](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.org/issues) on GitHub.

If you want to learn how to contribute to the archive yourself, the rest of
this section will document the process.
