Ace Archive is a project to preserve the history of queer communities, with a
particular focus on the asexual, aromantic, and other aspec communities.

Much of ace history is poorly documented, and between dead links, lost media,
and defunct websites, primary sources can be difficult to track down. The
purpose of this website is to consolidate important artifacts in ace history to
make them easy to find, and to act as a permanent home for these artifacts that
people can link to from blogs, wikis, etc.

Ace Archive is open-source and licensed under the [MIT
license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), which means that anyone is
free to [read the source code of the
website](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.lgbt) and use it however they
wish. It also means that much like a wiki, anyone can help contribute to the
archive, and we have [documentation]({{< ref
"docs/contributing/start.md" >}}) explaining how to do that.
