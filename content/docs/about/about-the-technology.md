In this section, we'll explain how Ace Archive uses distributed web technologies
to help reach its goals.

## The problem

Human history is being lost every day. The way the web currently works, any time
a website goes down, a service goes defunct, or content is moved, that data is
gone. Any time you link to content on the web, you're taking a gamble on how
long that content will be around.

What happens to projects like Ace Archive when someone decides to pull the plug
or there's nobody around to keep the lights on? All the content hosted on that
site disappears and links to that site go dead. This is where the distributed
web and [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech) come it.

## The distributed web

On the distributed web, content is *decentralized*, meaning you're not reliant
any one centralized authority to host it. With IPFS, a technology that powers
Ace Archive, all the data in the archive is published to a global public network
where anyone can access it, with out without this site.
