Hey, I'm Frawley (they/them)!

I made this site as a hobby project after I started researching asexual history
and grew frustrated by how difficult tracking down primary sources was. I wanted
to link to images and documents from my blog, but couldn't find links that I was
confident wouldn't succumb to [link
rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot).

I realized that a lot of ace history was close to becoming lost media, and that
some things, such as the [Haven for the Human
Amoeba](https://acearchive.lgbt/artifacts/haven-for-the-human-amoeba/)
community, possibly already had. I decided I wanted to do something about it.

The intent was for this site to serve two purposes:

1. Make it easy to find and browse primary sources related to asexual history.
2. Host files that don't otherwise have a permanent home on the web.

If you happen to be particularly knowledgeable about aro and ace history or have
files you want to contribute, [check out the docs]({{< ref
"docs/contributing/start" >}}) or [get in touch]({{< ref "contact" >}})!
