"Us" is a bit of a generous term; currently it's just me,
[Frawley](https://en.gravatar.com/frawleyskid).

I made this site as a hobby project after I started researching asexual history
and grew frustrated by how difficult tracking down primary sources was. I wanted
to link to images and documents from my blog, but couldn't find links that I was
confident wouldn't succumb to [link
rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot).

I realized that a lot of ace history was close to becoming lost media, and that
some things, such as the [Haven for the Human
Amoeba](https://acearchive.lgbt/artifacts/haven-for-the-human-amoeba/)
community, possibly already had. I decided I wanted to do something about it.

The intent was for this site to serve two purposes:

1. Make it easy to find and browse primary sources related to asexual history.
2. Host files that don't otherwise have a permanent home on the web.

While asexual history was (and still is) the primary focus, there's no reason
why the site couldn't host other artifacts related to queer history. So if you
happen to be particularly knowledgeable about other areas of queer history or
have files you want to contribute, [check out the docs]({{< ref
"docs/contributing/start" >}}) or [get in touch]({{< ref "contact" >}})!
