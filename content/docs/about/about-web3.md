In this section, we'll explain how Ace Archive uses Web3 technologies to help
reach its goals.

## The problem

Human history is being lost every day. The way the web currently works, any
time a website goes down, a service goes defunct, or content is moved, URLs
linking to that content go dead. Any time you link to content on the web,
you're taking a gamble on how long that content will be around.

What happens to projects like Ace Archive when someone decides to pull the plug
or there's nobody around to keep the lights on? All the content hosted on that
site disappears and links to that site go dead. This is where the distributed
web and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) come it.

## The distributed web

On the distributed web, content is *decentralized*, meaning you're not reliant
any one centralized authority to host it. With IPFS, the main technology that
powers Ace Archive, anyone can [help host the archive]({{< ref
"docs/contributing/hosting-artifacts.md" >}}), even from their own computer.
Ace Archive uses special [IPFS
permalinks](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs) that allow you to
locate content whether it's hosted on Ace Archive or somewhere else.

Even if Ace Archive goes defunct, anyone can help host the contents on the
distributed web so people can still find it using those same permalinks. And
because Ace Archive is open-source, anyone is free to take the code to the
website and host it themselves!
