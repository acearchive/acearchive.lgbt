Anyone can help contribute to Ace Archive, and there are various ways to
contribute for users of all skill levels.

The simplest way to contribute is to [suggest content to be added to the
archive](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.lgbt/issues/new?labels=artifact&template=artifact.yml).
All you have to do is fill out a form and answer a few questions. This requires
a GitHub account, which is free.

If you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, you can also [add content
to the archive yourself]({{< ref "docs/contributing/pull-request.md" >}}). The
process is somewhat more technical than contributing to a wiki, but we have
documentation to walk you through it. This also requires a GitHub account.

If you would like to report a bug or make a feature request, you can [open an
issue](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.lgbt/issues/new).

Another great way to contribute to Ace Archive is to [help host the
archive]({{< ref "docs/contributing/hosting-artifacts.md" >}}), which anyone
can do thanks to the distributed web. The ways you can help host the archive
range from hosting it from your own computer for free to using a hosting
provider. If you're a developer, make sure you check out [our
tooling](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-action) for working with the
archive.
