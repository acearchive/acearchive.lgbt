Anyone can help contribute to Ace Archive, and there are various ways to
contribute for users of all skill levels.

The simplest way to contribute is to [suggest content to be added to the
archive](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.lgbt/issues/new?labels=artifact&template=artifact.yml).
All you have to do is fill out a form and answer a few questions. This requires
a GitHub account, which is free.

If you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, you can also [add content
to the archive yourself]({{< ref "new-artifact/index.md" >}}). This involves
filling out a more comprehensive form where you'll enter all the information
necessary to add an artifact to the archive. Once you complete the form, you'll
be redirected to GitHub to submit your proposal for approval by a team member.

If you would like to report a bug or make a feature request, you can [open an
issue](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.lgbt/issues/new).

Another great way to contribute to Ace Archive is to [help host the archive]({{<
ref "docs/contributing/hosting-artifacts.md" >}}). The ways you can help host
the archive range from hosting it from your own computer for free to using a
hosting provider. This is currently a somewhat technical process. If you're a
developer, make sure you check
out [our tooling](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-action) for working
with the archive.
