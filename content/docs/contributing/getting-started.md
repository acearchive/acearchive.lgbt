Anyone can contribute content to the archive by [opening a pull request on
GitHub]({{< ref "docs/contributing/pull-request.md" >}}). The process is a
little more involved than contributing to a wiki, but we're working on finding
new ways to simplify it and make contributing as simple as possible.

If you have content you would like to suggest be added to the archive, but
would prefer not to add it yourself, you can [open an
issue](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.lgbt/issues/new?labels=artifact&template=artifact.yml)
on GitHub.

Another great way to contribute to Ace Archive is to [help host the
content]({{< ref "docs/contributing/hosting-artifacts.md" >}}), which anyone
can do thanks to IPFS.
