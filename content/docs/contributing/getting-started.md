Anyone can help contribute to Ace Archive, and there are various ways to
contribute for users of all skill levels.

<hr>

The simplest way to contribute is to suggest content to be added to the archive.
All you have to do is fill out a form and answer a few questions. This requires
a GitHub account, which is free.

Propose content

<hr>

If you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, you can also add content to
the archive yourself. This involves filling out a more comprehensive form where
you'll enter all the information necessary to add an artifact to the archive.
Once you complete the form, you'll be redirected to GitHub to submit your
proposal for approval by a team member.

Another great way to contribute to Ace Archive is to help host the archive. The
ways you can help host the archive range from hosting it from your own computer
for free to using a hosting provider. This is currently a somewhat technical
process. If you're a developer, make sure you check out [our
tooling](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-action) for working with the
archive.

If you're a developer or someone technically inclined, we have more technical
documentation on GitHub about how this site works and how to use [our
API](https://github.com/acearchive/artifact-action). We also maintain a few
ancillary projects relating to digital archiving, which you can check out [on
our GitHub page](https://github.com/acearchive).
