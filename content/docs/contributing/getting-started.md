Anyone can help contribute to Ace Archive, and there are various ways to
contribute for users of all skill levels.

<hr>

The simplest way to contribute is to suggest content to be added to the archive.
All you have to do is fill out a form and answer a few questions. This requires
a GitHub account, which is free.

<hr>

If you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, you can also add content to
the archive yourself. This involves filling out a more comprehensive form where
you'll enter all the information necessary to add an artifact to the archive.
Once you complete the form, you'll be redirected to GitHub to submit your
proposal for approval by a team member.
