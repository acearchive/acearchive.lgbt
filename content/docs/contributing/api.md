Ace Archive has a minimal REST API developers can use to query information about
artifacts in the archive.

Currently this API is experimental. The API is `v0`, which means that
**backwards-incompatible** changes could happen **at any time**.

To aid in development, at the bottom of each artifact page on this site, you'll
find that artifact's unique ID in the API.

Check out the API docs below.
