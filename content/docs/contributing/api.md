Ace Archive has a REST API developers can use to query information about
artifacts in the archive.

Currently this API is experimental. The API is in `v0`, which means that
backwards-incompatible changes could happen at any time.

At the bottom of each artifact page on the site, you'll find that artifact's
unique ID in the API.

Currently, you don't need an API key to use the API.
