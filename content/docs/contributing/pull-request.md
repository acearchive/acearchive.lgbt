The archive is hosted on GitHub, and to contribute content to the archive,
you'll need to open a *pull request*, which is a proposal to add content to a
code repository. It's easier than it sounds, and requires no programming or
knowledge of specialized tools! Just follow these steps:

1. Choose a [url slug]({{< ref "docs/contributing/artifact-files#url-slugs"
   >}}) for the new artifact.
2. Enter the URL slug into the box below and click "Open PR," which will
   redirect you to GitHub.
3. Fill in the provided [artifact file]({{< ref
   "docs/contributing/artifact-files" >}}) template in GitHub.
4. Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" at the
   bottom of the page and click "Propose new file."

This will open the page to create a new pull request. All you have to do is
briefly describe the new artifact you're adding and press "Create pull
request." Then, a team member can review your contribution and approve it!

Read on for more information about how to create an artifact file.
