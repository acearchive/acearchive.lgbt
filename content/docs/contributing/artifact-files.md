Every artifact in the archive has an *artifact file* associated with it in the
repository. An artifact file holds metadata about the artifact, including links
to the files associated with it. All you have to do to add content to the
repository is write an artifact file! This section will document the format of
artifact files and conventions for writing them.

## Creating an artifact file

Artifact files are written in YAML, which is is a format for representing
structured data in plain text. Writing artifact files is somewhat like using
the markup languages that are common when contributing to a wiki. You can learn
more about how to write YAML files
[here](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started).

Technically, an artifact file is a markdown document with a YAML frontmatter
block. However, no content goes in the body of the markdown document, so you
can think of it as a YAML file with a leading and trailing `---`.

You can [look through the
repository](https://github.com/acearchive/acearchive.lgbt/tree/main/content/archive)
to see examples of artifact files, but generally an artifact file will look
something like this:

## URL slugs

First, a note about URL slugs. Every artifact in the repository has a URL like
`/artifact/orlando-the-asexual-manifesto`. When you add a new artifact, you
will need to choose a URL slug for it.

A URL slug should always be kebab-case, and will generally follow the format
`author-title`. If the author has a first and last name (i.e. isn't a handle or
username), you can just use the last name. If the title of the work is long,
you can use a shortened version of it. If there is no obvious author associated
with the work, you can just use the title.

If the combination of the author and the title of the work is ambiguous, (such
as a forum thread where the title of the thread might just be "asexuality"),
then you can provide additional context like `context-author-title`. For an
AVEN forum thread by "coolasexualperson" called "romance", the URL slug might
be `aven-forums-coolasexualperson-romance`.

## Artifact fields

Next, we'll talk about the fields in an artifact file. Also take a look at the
[best practices]({{< ref "docs/contributing/best-practices.md" >}}) section for
more information on how to fill out these fields.

`title` *(string)*
: This is the title of the artifact. If the artifact represents a work (a book,
essay, forum thread, etc.), this will be the title of that work. If the
artifact encompasses multiple works or doesn't have an obvious title, it can be
a short description instead. You should always quote or italicize the titles of
works, and you can add italics in an artifact title using HTML `<em>Title of
Work</em>` syntax.

`description` *(string)*
: This is a short one-or-two sentence description of the artifact that should
provide context and explain its significance to the asexual community (i.e. why
it's in the archive). This is the description that will appear below each
artifact title in the list of artifacts.

`longDescription` *(string)*
: If you want to provide more context that you can fit in `description`, you
can optionally provide a longer description that will appear in the page for
the artifact. This field can be omitted, in which case it will just be the same
as `description`.

`files` *(list of dictionaries)*
: This section contains a list of references to the files associated with the
artifact. We'll cover adding files to artifacts [in more detail later]({{< ref
"docs/contributing/uploading-files.md" >}}).

`files.name` *(string)*
: The name of the file. This will appear in the list of files on the website; it
doesn't need to be a valid Windows/macOS/Linux file name and it doesn't need to
be unique. If the artifact consists of multiple works, this should generally be
the title of the work so people can disambiguate them. If the artifact consists
of a single work, it can just be something short like "Book", "Paper", etc. You
should also generally provide some information about the format of the work,
like specifying whether the file is a PDF or a plain text transcription.

`files.mediaType` *(string)*
: This is an optional IANA media type (also called a MIME type) for the file.
If the file is a format that doesn't have a well-known media type, you can omit
this. If you need help figuring out the media type of a file, you can use a
tool like [mimetype.io](https://mimetype.io/) to look it up.

`files.filename` *(string)*
: This is a file name for the file to be used when downloading it, meaning it
must always be a valid Windows/macOS/Linux file name. Generally kebab-case is
preferred, and you should always add an appropriate file extension.

`files.cid` *(string)*
: This is the IPFS CID of the file, which we'll talk about [in a later
section]({{< ref "docs/contributing/uploading-files.md#what-is-a-cid" >}}).

`people` *(list of strings)*
: This is a list of (usually 1-3) people closely associated with the artifact,
such as the author of a book, the subject of a photo, etc. This is helpful for
linking together different artifacts which are associated with the same people.
This list can be empty if the people associated with the artifact aren't clear.

`identities` *(list of strings)*
: A list of queer identities associated with the artifact. For example, if this
is a blog post about aromanticism, then "aromantic" should be included in the
list of identities. The identity should be in adjective form, meaning it can
complete the sentence, "Artifacts about _ people". This list can be empty if
the identities associated with the work aren't clear (e.g. it's about queer
identities as a whole).

`fromYear` *(integer)*
: The year the work associated with the artifact was published (or written,
posted, etc.). If the artifact encompasses multiple works that were published
in different years, you should specify a range of years using this field and
`toYear`.

`toYear` *(integer)*
: This value can be used with `fromYear` to specify a range of years. If the
works associated with the artifact were only published in one year, this should
be omitted.

`decades` *(list of integers)*
: The list of decades between `fromYear` and `toYear`. For example, if
`fromYear` is 1980 and `toYear` is 1999, this should be `[1980, 1990]`.
