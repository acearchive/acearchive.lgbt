This page describes a more technical approach for contributing content to Ace
Archive. If you're not familiar with YAML or git, using [this form]({{<
ref "new-artifact/index.md" >}}) is the easiest way to contribute an artifact to
the repository. All the documentation on this page is also available on that
form.
{{< /alert >}}

Every artifact in the archive has an *artifact file* associated with it in the
git repo. An artifact file holds metadata about the artifact, including the
files and links associated with it.

An artifact file is a markdown document containing a YAML front matter block,
however no content goes in the body of the markdown file, so you can just think
of it as a YAML file with a leading and trailing `---` line.

Artifact files are stored in
the [`acearchive/artifacts`](https://github.com/acearchive/artifacts)
repo. The file name of the artifact file is the URL slug of the artifact.

Generally an artifact file will look something like this:

## Schema

Next, we'll look at the schema of artifact files. Also take a look at the
[best practices]({{< ref "docs/contributing/best-practices.md" >}}) section for
more information on how to fill out these fields.
